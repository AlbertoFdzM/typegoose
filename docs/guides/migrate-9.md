These are the changes made for 9.0.0 that are breaking or just important to know

## Requirements changed

- Mongoose `6.0.0` or [higher is now required](#mongoose-60-is-now-supported)

<!--TODO: update migration guide URL when mongoose 6.0 is released-->

Mongoose version `6.0.0` (and possibly higher) is now supported, for mongoose specific migration, look at the [6.0 migration guide](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/blob/6.0/migrating_to_6.md)
